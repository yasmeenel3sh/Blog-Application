# üìù Blog API

A RESTful blog API built with **Ruby on Rails**, supporting authentication, post and comment management, tagging, and automatic cleanup. Containerized using **Docker** with dedicated setups for development and testing.

## Features

- JWT authentication (signup/login)
- Create, read, update, and delete blog posts
- Each post must have at least one tag
- Add, edit, and delete comments
- Only post authors can modify and delete their posts and comments
- Posts auto-deleted 24 hours after creation (via Sidekiq)
- RSpec test suite

## Development Setup

1. **Build and start development environment**

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

This will start the app, database, Redis, and Sidekiq for development.

## Running Tests

1. **Start test environment with services**

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d --build
```

2. **Run test suite**

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml run test bundle exec rspec
```
